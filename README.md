This is the implementation of Apriori Algorithm in python. The apriori algorithm uncovers hidden structures in categorical data.Apriori algorithm refers to the algorithm which is used to calculate the association rules between objects. It means how two or more objects are related to one another. In other words, we can say that the apriori algorithm is an association rule leaning that analyzes that people who bought product A also bought product B.

The primary objective of the apriori algorithm is to create the association rule between different objects.

Assumptions made :

1.Before running either change the name of yor csv file to dataset.csv or change "dataset.csv" in read_csv function to your filename.
2.The format of your csv file should be the same as demonstrated in the demo csv file attached.
3.The code outputs the final frequent subsets and takes minimum support as input from user.
4.The dataset.csv file was used to run the algorithm on demo data.
